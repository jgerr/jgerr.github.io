		<h2>Nice to meet you!</h2>
		<p>	One way or another, you've managed to stumble upon Joanna Gerr's portfolio. Welcome!</p>
		<p> Well, who exactly is that? I'm currently a senior at Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology. As the categories on the left indicate, my main interests lie in Computer Science and Design-type fields. I've taken CompSci courses for all four years in which I've been at school, going beyond AP CompSci and into Artificial Intelligence and Web + Mobile Application Development, and culminating in my being a part of Thomas Jefferson's Computer Systems senior lab. </p>
		<p>Animation is a field near and dear to me that I have pursued outside of my classes for many years. Having grown up on the animated films of Studio Ghibli, I developed a fondness for traditional frame-by-frame animation. Around the start of middle school, my parents gifted me with a copy of Adobe Flash CS 5.5 so that I could make my own. Since then, I've created two longer animations, over fifty .gif animations for e-books for disabled children learning to communicate, and numerous other short animations for fun.</p>
		<p>Over the past fourteen years, I've learned to both play and love the piano. It's more than just simply practicing for competitions and drilling technique; the compositions of romantic composers as Debussy and Ravel and contemporary composers like Joe Hisaishi and Akira Yuyama have inspired me to create my own music. </p>
