                            A <a href="https://gerr.itch.io/alls-fair-in-love-and-the-board">visual novel about CHESS</a>, unlike any you've ever seen. The Consultants for Hectic Emergencies and Solid Solutions (CHESS) have hired you, a recent graduate from the Prestigious Academy for Wholesome Normies (PAWN). And you've been tasked with capturing your coworker's hearts!

                        This game was inspired by several things, among them: <i>The Garden of Forking Paths</i> by Jorge Luis Borges, the medieval theme and hierarchy inherently present in nomenclature of Chess, the experience of working a corporate 9-5, and dating sim visual novels (VN).

                        The first insight that led to this game's creation was a linguistic one. In game design, it is crucial to think about verbs that define the player experience. Amusingly, chess and dating sims share one essential verb: <b>capture</b>. In the former, you capture your target's pieces, and in the latter, you capture your target's heart. Taking the metaphor a step further, both are games of strategy. And if your strategy works, you win. To solidify this relation between chess and dating-sim strategy, certain dialogue options are presented as moves on a chessboard. A playing field and playing <i>the</i> field have a lot in common!

                        The second insight revolved around the structure of narratives. Anyone who has played a game of chess can tell you that the <b>possibility space</b> of a single game is vast. <i>The Garden of Forking Paths</i> contains a key insight of a similar nature: narratives do not need to be linear, either. This is true now more than ever; modern mediums, like video games, have been used to tell acclaimed non-linear narratives. VNs are one such type of game that features non-linearity, yet despite their branching structure, many require the player to play all routes for the <i>true</i> ending. Just like in a game of chess, there is always a final end.

                        The third insight that shaped this game was that of chess's thematic nomenclature. Inherent in how chess pieces are named and function is a clear power <b>hierarchy</b>, with pawns seated solidly at the bottom. It's a dramatic setting on its own: two sides, black and white, Montagues and Capulets. Can you imagine the pawn who succeeds in capturing a rook? They'd get a promotion, surely! To hammer home this hierarchy, I framed a game of chess in a setting us 21st-century folk know all about: the workplace. No pawn would want to attempt capturing a rook on their own, but if your boss demands it, and your promotion is at stake... then, so be it.
