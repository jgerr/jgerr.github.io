		<h2>Apps</h2>
		<p> In my spare time, I enjoy coding a variety of mobile and web-based applications. Presented here are a few that I've picked out because they represent my interest and efforts in many aspects of creative media, among them graphics, sound, and interaction design, the best.</p>
		<h3 id=mobile> gouda-cchi</h3> 
		<table width=100%><tr>
		<td width=25%><img src="gouda-cchi.png" width=100%></td>
		<td style="font-size:14px">Under the moniker <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8770044791176439093">gouda-cchi</a>, I've developed a number of Android applications. The name sounds like the first 3/4 of "gouda cheese", and since "gou" is Chinese for "dog", my icon is a cheese dog.  <td>

		<h3> Hibearnation </h3>
		<video autoplay loop muted=true class=center ><source src="bearvid_rotated.mp4" type="video/mp4"  ></video>
		<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goudacchi.Hibearnation">Hibearnation</a> has thirty distinct levels, each of which must be traversed successfully in order to advance onto the next. I developed this game using C++ in Unity, which included designing the levels, scripting behaviours for different terrains, and implementing Accelerometer-based motion controls for the player character, among more. This demonstration shows Level 17, which features four vegetables to be collected, and three different types of terrain: the normal orange bricks, white snow, and blue ice. </p>
		
		<h3> Downboar </h3>
		<table width=100%><tr>
		<td width=50% valign=top ><video autoplay loop muted=true width=100%><source src="pigvid.mp4" type="video/mp4" ></video></td>
		<td style="padding-left:4%" valign=top ><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goudacchi.Downboar">Downboar</a> is a light shoot-em-up style game where the player avoids a head-on collision with the bullets and instead gathers points from lightly grazing them. I developed it in C++ with Unity, creating many types of bullets and varied phases with structured patterns. In this demonstration, slow, normal, fast, and homing bullets appear at different intervals, and patterns like a V-shaped formation and parallel straight lines are exhibited.<td>
		</tr></table>
		
		<h3 id=web>Canvas</h3>
		<img src="piggirl.png" class=center>
		<p><a href="Canvas\Canvas.html">Canvas</a> is a simple image drawing and editing web application made using HTML5. As illustrated in the image made with Canvas above, it offers freedrawing, color selection, resizable brush width, saving and uploading capabilities, among more! In addition, all icon graphics were done by yours truly.</p>
		
		<h3>Kaleidoscope</h3>
		<img src="kaleidoscope.png" class=center width=50%>
		<p>I created a simple <a href="kaleidoscope.html">kaleidoscope</a> to experiment with animation using an HTML5 canvas. It generates random patterns with various colors, and continues for as long as it remains open.</p>
		
		<h3> Pause! </h3>
		<table width=100%><tr>
		<td width=25% valign=top ><img src="1.gif" width=100%></td>
		<td style="padding-left:4%" valign=top ><a href="pause.html">Pause!</a> is a web application that plays the selected video for a random amount of time before pausing and sending a balloon up. To get the video to resume, the viewer must pop the balloon. This interactive exercise was made for the Fairfax Assistive Technology instructors to help their students with learning difficulties.<td>
		</tr></table>
		<!-- <h3>Ebay Searcher</h3>
		<p><a href="Ebay/SiteSearcher.html">Ebay Searcher</a> is a web application that displays ebay listings under a certain keyword reformatted to show the most applicable information. By selecting different column headers, the rows will update to show the listings in ascending or descending order by that category.</p>-->
