		<td style="font-size:14px">Under the moniker <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/dev?id=8770044791176439093">gouda-cchi</a>, I've developed a number of Android applications. The name combines Gouda cheese with -cchi, a suffix that sounds like the beginning of the word "cheese". Reorganizing the letters in "gouda" can yield "da gou", which means big dog in Chinese. Hence why my icon is a cheesy-looking dog! <td>

		<h3> Hibearnation </h3>
		<video autoplay loop muted=true class=center ><source src="bearvid_rotated.mp4" type="video/mp4"  ></video>
		<p><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goudacchi.Hibearnation">Hibearnation</a> has thirty distinct levels, each of which must be traversed successfully in order to advance onto the next. I developed this game using C++ in Unity, which included designing the levels, scripting behaviours for different terrains, and implementing Accelerometer-based motion controls for the player character, among more. This demonstration shows Level 17, which features four vegetables to be collected, and three different types of terrain: the normal orange bricks, white snow, and blue ice. </p>

		<td style="padding-left:4%" valign=top ><a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.goudacchi.Downboar">Downboar</a> is a light shoot-em-up style game where the player avoids a head-on collision with the bullets and instead gathers points from lightly grazing them. I developed it in C++ with Unity, creating many types of bullets and varied phases with structured patterns. In this demonstration, slow, normal, fast, and homing bullets appear at different intervals, and patterns like a V-shaped formation and parallel straight lines are exhibited.<td>

As illustrated in the image made with Canvas above, it offers freedrawing, color selection, resizable brush width, saving and uploading capabilities, among more! In addition, all icon graphics were done by yours truly.</p>
