PokeMonitor is a D3 visualization that shows what a beginning Pokemon trainer in the Kanto region will encounter as they embark on their very own Pokemon journey. The spawn data and optimal adventure order have been sourced from the [StrategyWiki](https://strategywiki.org/wiki/Pok%C3%A9mon_Red_and_Blue/Pallet_Town) for Pokemon Red. We've included Pokemon from the original 150 that spawn on land, in caves, via fishing, via surfing, and through special encounters (hi Zapdos!).

On Pokemonitor, you'll be able to perform any of several interactions:
- You can monitor a beginning trainer's adventure throughout Kanto by using the buttons at the bottom right of the map. Play/Pause their adventure, Step Forward or Backward one locale at a time, and reset their adventure to the beginning.
- Hovering over a region gives its name and by clicking directly on the map, you can instantly travel to a region in Kanto and view the spawn rates for that region.
- To view more information on a Pokemon that spawns in a given region, you can hover over the bars in the bar chart at the right. A tooltip will show you the Pokemon in question, and provide you with basic statistics about its type, weight, height, and spawn gender ratio (if applicable).
